# ATM
Simple ATM/bank account simulator, for coding/testing/GUI practice.

I built this as a practice project, to experiment with the wxpython GUI and to practice Test driven development, good code hygene, etc. I'll include simple examples of each component required to complete the project, with the goal of helping others learn & for my own recap.
