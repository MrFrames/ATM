# ATM
Simple ATM/bank account simulator, for coding/testing/GUI practice.

I built this as a practice project, to experiment with the wxpython GUI and to practice Test driven development, good code hygene, etc. I'll include simple examples of each component required to complete the project, with the goal of helping others learn & for my own recap.

TODO:

> Add dates to account history data.
> Improve the layout of the history panel, better process for updating table perhaps? -  Table in new window perhaps?
> Research password storage and login protocols - update if neccessary.
> Write simple examples of code required to complete project:
  > Password with salt, login function
  > Unit testing implimentation
  > Creating simple app (Frame)
  > Action bindings
  > Creating panels & changing between them
  > Layout using sizers
  > Inputting data via txtCtrl, check boxes & passing data to functions
  > Creating a Template panel, feeding different variables to different instances
  > Creating a graph with wxplotframe
  > Creating, populating & updating a table within a panel.
